        <h2>But what even is <strong>Bolognese</strong>?</h2>
        <p>
          Bolognese sauce, or ragù alla bolognese, is a slow-cooked Italian meat
          sauce traditionally served with tagliatelle. It's made with ground
          beef (sometimes pork), onion, carrot, celery, a small amount of
          tomato, wine, and milk, giving it a rich, savory flavor that's less
          tomato-heavy than many pasta sauces.
        </p>
        <p>
          It comes from Bologna in northern Italy and evolved from earlier meat
          ragùs in the 18th century. Over time, it became a classic regional
          dish, with an official traditional recipe recorded in 1982 to preserve
          its authenticity.
